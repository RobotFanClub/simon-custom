# Custom Theme for [simonpeng.net](https://simonpeng.net)

![Screenshot of theme](/Screenshot.png)

This is my attempt at making a custom theme for my micro.blog site.

Most of this theme is based on the default micro.blog theme, with a lot of custom styling to suit my particular taste and ideas. Some of my personal branding and writing is baked into the theme. 

### Credits

This site uses the font families [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/), [ANRT-Baskervville](https://github.com/anrt-type/ANRT-Baskervville), and [Drafting* Mono](https://indestructibletype.com/Drafting/).

This site *used to* use the theme [Tiny Theme](https://tiny.micro.blog) by [Matt Langford](https://www.mattlangford.com). Some elements of that theme were used in my custom theme to preserve functionality. You should check out Tiny Theme and support Matt if you borrow any code from my theme.

### Note on This Project's Usefulness for Others

This is also my first experiment with using Github and Git in general since... a very long time. It's also my first time doing all of this on my own without more experienced people dragging me along. All this is to say that it is meant to be a fun learning experience, but is likely not very useful for anyone else with more experience than none.
